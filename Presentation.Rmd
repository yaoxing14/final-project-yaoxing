# Research Question

What characteristics of pets make them more likely to find new homes?

---

# Data & Sample

Sample: 5,000 records from data/aac_small.csv
10 variables

- `animal_type`: Type of pets in the shelter (Cat and Dog)
- `breed`: Pet breed
- `sex_upon_intake`: Sex and neuter status of the animal when it enters the shelter
- `sex_upon_outcome`: Sex and neuter status of the animal when it leaves the shelter
- `age_upon_intake`: Age of the animal when it enters the shelter
- `age_upon_outcome`: Age of the animal when it leaves the shelter
- `intake_type`: How the animal entered the shelter (Stray, Owner Surrender, etc.)
- `intake_condition`: Physical condition of the animal when it entered the shelter
- `outcome_type`: Final outcome (Adopted, Transferred, etc.)
- `time_in_shelter_days`: Number of days the animal stayed in the shelter

---

# Exploratory Analysis

Here’s what I looked at first to get a feel for the data:

- Adoption rate by pet type, breed, sex at intake  

- Distribution of days in shelter by outcome  

- Intake method vs. adoption outcome

---

# Adoption Rate by Pet Type
*Dogs are adopted at slightly higher rates than cats.*  

<div style="text-align:center">

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.height=6}
aac %>%
  count(animal_type, outcome_binary) %>%
  group_by(animal_type) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(animal_type, prop, fill=outcome_binary)) +
    geom_col(position="fill") +
    labs(x="Pet Type", y="Adoption Rate", fill="Outcome") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
```

# Shelter Stay by Outcome

<div style="text-align:center">

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(aac, aes(outcome_binary, time_in_shelter_days)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Outcome", y = "Days in Shelter") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

# Intake Method vs Adoption

<div style="text-align:center">

```{r echo=FALSE}
freq_table <- aac %>%
  count(intake_type, outcome_binary) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = outcome_binary, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)
knitr::kable(freq_table) 
```

---
# Logistic Regression Results

```{r echo=FALSE}
top_breeds <- aac %>% count(breed) %>% top_n(10, n) %>% pull(breed)  
aac2 <- aac %>%  
  mutate(  
    breed2    = if_else(breed %in% top_breeds, breed, "Other"),  
    outcome01  = if_else(outcome_type=="Adoption", 1, 0)  
  )

model2 <- glm(  
  outcome01 ~ animal_type + sex_upon_intake + intake_type +  
              intake_condition + time_in_shelter_days + breed2,  
  data = aac2, family = "binomial"  
)

broom::tidy(model2) %>%  
  filter(p.value < 0.05) %>%  
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

# Conclusions

- Neutered pets, good intake condition, and shorter stays → higher adoption odds  
- Breed and age also play a role (puppies/kittens adopted faster)  
- Intake method (Stray vs. Surrender) significantly affects outcome
